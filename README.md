# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based application developed in C# to efficiently manage library operations. This system is built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it modular and easy to maintain. It can be developed and managed within Visual Studio or any other compatible C# Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
